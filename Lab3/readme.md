# Executive Summary 
In this chapter I plan to learn many things. I am hoping I will gain more skills that I will be able to use in the future that will give me more reach inside my career. What I will be learning about is software and python. I will also be exploring career fields in the tech industry and seeing where I would want to be involved.

# Software 
The role of the operating system software is to manage hardware and create the interface between between the harware and user. A few examples of a Operating system software are Macos, Microsoft and Linux.
The role of application software is to perform specific goals such as word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, and surfing the internet. An example of application software is Microsoft Excel.
The role of utility software is to modify your compuetr in some way. An example of utility software is an anti-malware software/program that can remove software you no longer want installed.
The purpose of ERP software is to bring together  an entire organization within one program. An exmaple of ERP software is Google Google docs.

# Python
What is meant by the pseudo-code nature of Python is that Python does not involve any code in it.
What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language? In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine.

# Career Exploration 
## College Central
From my research I have found a few opportunities on this website. Although there are not many internships, I am looking forward to applying and hopefully getting a response from one of them.
### Certifications
What I have learned is that considering I am starting out with no certificates, the Comptia A is the best option for me to try to get at this moment.
#### Certificates
A certificate I am interested in is cyber security. In the future, I plan on taking my degree using the knowledge I gained to pursue a career in cyber security.
##### Co-ops / Internships
What I need to do to become co-op ready is to schedule an appointment with a career coach, so he or she can help me through the process. The benefits of a co-op program is that it will give me hands on experience in the career field I am currently pursuing.
###### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
One of the clubs that my school offer that I find very interesting is Cyber Security Club. This club will bring everyone who enjoys cyber security together. This club will also help each other in learning the cyber security skill; as well as, compete in competitions to gain a hands on experience.

# Conclusion
This was one of my favorite labs. I learned a lot about software and Python. Learning Python was a hard but fun experience. I am excited to be one step closer to my goals, I plan on using python everyday just for more practice. I also got to schedule an appoinment with the career coach to help me find opportunities for cyber security internships. During this lab I also signed up to be a member of the cyber security team, hopefully I get accepted this should be a fun experience and great hands on experience.
