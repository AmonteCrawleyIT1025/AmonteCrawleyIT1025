# Executive Summary
In this Lab I plan on learning more about internet structuring and programming. While doing some reading I read that developing new websites and programming was a very difficult task. I am very excited to dive into this and see what there is to learn about Internet Architecture and Programming.
# Internet Architecture 
## Internet Protocol
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address.
ICANN is the private, non-government, nonprofit corporation with responsibility for Internet Protocol (IP) address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system (DNS) management and root server system management functions. ICANN manages the distribution and allocation of IP version 4 and IP version 6 network addresses through five regional internet registries.
#  TCP/IP
TCP/IP is responsible for full-fledged internet data connectivity and transmitting the data end to end by providing other functions, including addressing, mapping and acknowledgment. The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.
Each protocol in the stack is responsible for a specific task, and by layering them, we can create a more robust and reliable system. The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients.
#  Internet Security
The HTTP is the Web's application layer protocol works on the Client-Server technology. The client request for the HTML pages towards server and the server responses with HTML pages. In this, the client requests pages and objects through its agent and Server responses them with the requested objects by displaying.
HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS).
# Securing Your Web Browser
Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
#  Internet Programming 
###  World Wide Web Consortium
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards.
HTML essentially, is the code that dictates where all the website elements are and how they appear to the user.
###  HTML5 and CSS
The approach I took for my website was to make it simple, yet effective. While using the website I designed in a brief moment you will be able to learn many things about why video game violence is not appropriate for children.
### HTML and XML
The key difference between HTML and XML is that HTML displays data and describes the structure of a webpage, whereas XML stores and transfers data.
# Components of a URL 
Every URL begins with the scheme. This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly. There are many types of schemes, but for typical web browsing you will mostly see http and https. 
The domain name is the most prominent part of a web address. Typically, different pages on the same site will continue to use the same domain name. The domain on the right is called a top-level domain such as .edu. The anchor tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page. Some URLs include a string of characters after the path—beginning with a question mark—called the parameter string.

# Conclusion 
Although I did not see myself enjoying creating a new website, I actually found it very fun. It was very complicated, however the process was so fun that I looked over the difficulty. I see that there is a lot to learn about Internet architecture and programming . I will commit a lot of my time to learning more.
