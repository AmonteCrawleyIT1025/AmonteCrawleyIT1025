# Data, Information and Knowledge 
Data is raw, unprocessed facts. It can be numbers, words, images, or sounds, among other things. Data by itself doesn't have much meaning or context.
Information is data that has been processed and organized in a way that gives it meaning and context. Information is useful because it can be used to answer questions, solve problems, or make decisions. Knowledge is understanding and familiarity with a subject or skill, gained through experience or education. It is the combination of information and the understanding of how to use that information to make informed decisions and take appropriate action.
The primary key in the customers table would be a unique identifier for each customer, such as a customer ID number. The primary key in the orders table would be a unique identifier for each order, such as an order number.

The customers and orders tables would be related through the use of a foreign key in the orders table. The foreign key would be the customer ID from the customers table, and it would be used to link each order to the customer who placed it.

For example, if a customer with the ID number 123 placed an order, the orders table might have an entry with the order number 4567 and the foreign key 123, indicating that order 4567 was placed by customer 123. This allows the database to store and retrieve information about both customers and orders in a structured and organized way, and to easily retrieve all of the orders placed by a particular customer by using the customer's ID as a key.

It is important to properly define the data type of a field in a database table because the data type determines what kind of data can be stored in that field, as well as how the data will be processed and used.

# Big Data
The four "Vs" of big data are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. These characteristics refer to the challenges and opportunities associated with managing and analyzing large amounts of data.
Volume refers to the sheer size of the data. Big data often involves very large datasets that can be difficult to store, process, and analyze using traditional methods.
Variety refers to the different types and formats of data that are included in a big data set. Big data can include structured data, such as numbers and text in a spreadsheet or database, as well as unstructured data, such as images, audio, and video.
Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed. In some cases, data must be analyzed in real-time, as it is being generated.
Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of the data. In a big data set, there may be errors, inconsistencies, or missing data that need to be cleaned and checked before the data can be analyzed.
The proliferation of connected devices, such as smartphones, smart watches, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which generate vast amounts of data as they communicate with each other and with online servers.

# Structured Query Language 
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a type of database management system that organizes data into tables (also called relations) and allows users to create relationships between these tables using primary and foreign keys.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in RDBMS. SQL is used to create, modify, and query relational databases, as well as to control access to the data.

The purpose of SQL is to provide a standard way of interacting with RDBMS and to allow users to easily retrieve, manipulate, and update data stored in a database. SQL includes a wide range of commands and functions that can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as creating and modifying database tables, inserting and updating data, and querying the database for specific information.

# SQL Injections 
SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that involves injecting malicious code into a website or application through user input fields. The code is written in SQL, the programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

SQL injection attacks are a security threat because they allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to a database, steal sensitive information, or manipulate or delete data. They can also be used to take control of a website or application, or to perform other malicious actions.

One way to reduce the issue is by enforcing strong passwords and using secure authentication: Using strong, unique passwords and implementing secure authentication methods can help to prevent unauthorized access to a database.

# Ethical and Legal Implications 
### Code of Ethics
A code of ethics is a set of principles that outline the values and behaviors that are expected of individuals or organizations in a particular field or profession. Codes of ethics are designed to guide the actions of professionals and provide a framework for ethical decision-making.

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a professional organization for computer scientists, software engineers, and other computing professionals. The ACM created a code of ethics for the computing discipline to provide guidance and standards for ethical conduct in the field of computing.

A code of ethics is a set of principles that outline the values and behaviors that are expected of individuals or organizations in a particular field or profession. A code of ethics is designed to guide the actions of professionals and provide a framework for ethical decision-making.

An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a set of rules that outline the acceptable use of a particular service or resource, such as a computer network, online platform, or software application. An AUP is typically used to define the terms of use for a service and to set boundaries for acceptable behavior.

### Intellectual Property
The purpose of WIPO is to promote the creation, use, and protection of IP as a means of stimulating economic, social, and cultural development. The organization works to improve the legal and policy frameworks for IP, and to provide technical assistance and support to countries around the world in the development and implementation of IP systems.

The importance of WIPO lies in its role in promoting the use and protection of IP as a means of fostering innovation, creativity, and economic development. Intellectual property, which includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, is a key contributor to economic growth and competitiveness, and the work of WIPO helps to ensure that IP systems are effective and fair.

A copyright is obtained automatically when a work is created and fixed in a tangible form, such as when an artist creates a painting, or a writer creates a novel. A copyright gives the creator of a work certain exclusive rights to control the use and distribution of the work, including the right to reproduce, distribute, display, and create derivative works based on the original work.

In the United States, copyright protection is automatic, but creators can choose to register their work with the US Copyright Office to further protect their rights. Registering a copyright with the Copyright Office has several benefits:
It creates a public record of the copyright claim.
It allows the owner of the copyright to bring a lawsuit in federal court to enforce their rights.
It provides the owner of the copyright with certain additional legal remedies, such as the ability to seek statutory damages and attorneys' fees.
It can make it easier to prove ownership of the copyright in the event of a dispute.
It might be important to copyright an SVG image you created if you plan to distribute or sell the image, or if you want to protect your rights to the image. Registering the copyright would provide you with additional legal protection and allow you to enforce your rights if someone uses the image without your permission.

A trademark is a type of intellectual property that is used to identify and distinguish a product or service from those of others. If the SVG image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, it could potentially be used as a trademark. The role of a trademark in defining intellectual property is to protect the distinctive identity of a product or service and to prevent others from using similar marks that could confuse consumers. If your SVG image is used as a trademark, you would have the exclusive right to use the image as a trademark, and you could seek legal remedies if someone infringes on your trademark rights. Overall, trademarks play an important role in defining and protecting intellectual property by helping to distinguish brands and products, and by providing legal protection for the use of distinctive marks.

# Information Collection
COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) is a federal law in the United States that regulates the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. COPPA requires that websites and online services that collect personal information from children obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing the personal information.

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. FERPA applies to schools and educational institutions that receive federal funding, and it requires that these institutions have written consent from a student's parent or guardian before disclosing the student's education records to third parties.

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a federal law that protects the privacy of personal health information. HIPAA applies to healthcare providers, health plans, and other organizations that handle personal health information, and it requires that these entities have appropriate safeguards in place to protect the privacy of this information.
