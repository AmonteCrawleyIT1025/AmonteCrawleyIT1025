# Executive Summary
Considering my degree in the works is cyber security I am excited to begin learning more information about my career field. I plan on take this knowlege and applying it to my career. I know there is a lot to learn about cyber security, but I am ready to take on any challenge that comes my way. 

# Lucidchart
My experience with lucidchart felt first nature considering I have used it before. However, now I know how I will be able to utilize this for my career.

# Introduction to Networking

## Network Hardware
The benefit of a switch is that it reduces any unnecessary traffic on the network.
The benefit of routers over hubs and switches is that the router provides the full duplex mode of transmission. Hub provides the half duplex mode of transmission

### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is when a central point or hub fails and all computers on that central point become affected. The type of topologies that experience this is star and ring.
Comparing a Wireless Mesh and Infrastructure Topology I would have to say that Wireless Mesh is better considering it seems like it will give off the strongest signal and when one structure fails others can still work off of each other.

#### NSA/CSS
NSA Cybersecurity prevents and eradicates threats to U.S. national security systems with a focus on the Defense Industrial Base and the improvement of weapons’ security.

# Cybersecurity and Encryption 

##  Information Systems Security
If I were part of Amazon.com online chat the confidentiality would have to stay at a minimum. Meaning some things are not given to the public and only stays between certain employees. Integrity would be making sure that the information being accessed has not been altered and truly represents what is intended. Lastly, I would make sure the availability is only accessible to the appropriate user.
Three daily tasks that would require authentication would be logging on to your phone, accessing an area that requires card access, and logging on to the computer. Each one could be converted into multi-factor authentication if they combine two or more of these factors: Something they know, Something they have, or Something they are.
 
Access control determines which users are authorized to read, modify, add, and/or delete information. Two of the more common are: the Access Control List (ACL) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). An information security employee can produce an ACL which identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific actions with an information resource such as data files. Specific permissions are assigned to each user such as read, write, delete, or add. Only users with those permissions are allowed to perform those functions. The primary drawback of ACL is that each information resource is managed separately, so if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. Role-based access control, or RBAC. With RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access.

Explaining the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key. 
Firstly, obtain the public key, encode the message, and send it. The recipient then uses their private key to decode it. The public key can be given to anyone who wishes to send the recipient a message. Each user simply needs one private key and one public key in order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order to decrypt a message sent with the public key.

we need public key cryptography to keep privacy between two users who do not want others knowing certain information that they're trying to share from a distance.

# Cryptography 
I typed a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration'' box and turned the wheel to encrypt a message. What happened was that the letters I used in my message were assigned a certain letter to help encrypt the message.

I typed a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" the result I got were higher frequencies of the letters I used. The more I used one letter the higher the frequency of that letter got. It would be different for different languages because some languages have different spellings. 

A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets.

I typed a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. The results I got were a encrypted and decrypted message.

# Brute-Force
A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by application programs to decode login information and encryption keys to use them to gain unauthorized access to systems. It relates with Kerckhoffs’s principle because it is a concept that a Cryptographic system should be designed to be secure, even if all its details, except for the key, are publicly known.

# Conclusion
Learning about cyber security is fun. I see that cyber security has many things to do with network connection, encryption keys, and more. I see there is a lot to learn, I should be studying more often on my off time to review the different information I learn. In cyber secuirty you never stop learning their are new things to learn everyday.
