# Introduction to Networking
## Network Hardware
The benefit of a switch is that it reduces any unnecessary traffic on the network.
The benefit of routers over hubs and switches is that the router provides the full duplex mode of transmission. Hub provides the half duplex mode of transmission
### Network Topologies
Single point of failure is when a central point or hub fails and all computers on that central point become affected. The type of topologies that experience this is star and ring.
Comparing a Wireless Mesh and Infrastructure Topology I would have to say that Wireless Mesh is better considering it seems like it will give off the strongest signal and when one structure fails others can still work off of each other.
#### NSA/CSS
