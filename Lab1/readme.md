# Executive Summary
The Purpose of Lab 1 is to examine the history of Information Technology, to see how it has developed over time, and to get an underdtanding of GiHub. Lab 1 was a very good intro into IT. I found it interesting how the The World Wide Web was not introduced into the world until 1989. While doing this Lab I am excited to use GitHub I will be able to collect and organize data of my work using this application software over time.
# Information Systems Component 
An Information system I use everyday is my phone. The hardware is the phone itself. The software my phone uses is IOS. The data it collects is everything that includes my pictures, contacts, messages, health and more. The people would be the workers at apple who developed my phone. The process would be apple workers creating the phone by starting with the software and eventually work towards the hardware. I then can buy the phone and enter my data in on the phone.
# GitHub 
The aspects of the the client-side on GitHub is the ability for users to be able to acess GitHub on the user computer. While, the server-side means they have to access GitHub through the internet. "GitHub Desktop" what this mean for the client server architecture is that you can now use it without web browser.
# Cloud Computing 
The reason GitHub is considered cloud computing is for the simple fact that it can be used remote on a server where we can store, manage, and process data. Another cloud computing enviroment I use is Google Cloud.
# Conclusion
From this Lab I have learned the history of Information Technology and how it has developed into our daily lives. Seeing how businesses transfered their data from pen and paper to all there data online and advertising online was very interesting to me. Although, I never used GitHub I found it fairly easy to work with. Hopefully in the future I will get to use it more and become more familiar with it.
