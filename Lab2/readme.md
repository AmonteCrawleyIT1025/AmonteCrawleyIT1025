# Executive Summary
 From this section I learned that the computer is not one part doing all the work. There are many parts of a computer that we fail to realize that makes the computer run properly. Many people tend to think it's time to buy a new computer, when really all the computer needs is an upgrade in hardware.
# Hard Drives
What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in a hard drive? The difference is that latency is the amount of time it takes for a desired sector to rotate under the read/write heads of the disk drive. While, transfer rate is the time it takes to transmit data from one spot to another.

What is the difference between a SSD hard drive and a traditional hard drive? The difference is that a SSD hard drive has no moving parts, while the traditional hard drive has moving parts. The traditional hard drive also takes very long to start up, because you have to wait for the disk to start spinning.  A SSD can be accessed immediately making it faster and more reliable.

Why does adding more RAM make a computer run faster? By increasing the amount of RAM on a computer more data can be loaded into the faster RAM without the need of constantly accessing the slower hard drive.

What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? The difference is 64 bit can transfer 64 bit of data at a time, making it faster than 32 bit. 32 bit can transfer 32 bit at a time.
 
 # ALU and the Control Unit
 The Control Unit is like the captain of the army. It recieves info from the RAM and tell the ALU what type of operation to perform. ALU then performs the operation and outputs the answers.
 
 # CPU, Input & Output 
When you press a letter on a key board that letter is sent as binary. The CPU then calculates how to display the letter. Next, the CPU ask instructions from memory on how to draw the letter. The CPU then runs the instructions and stores it in memory. Finally, information is then sent to the screen in binary, the screen is the output source.

#  IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE purpose is dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It's important for designers to understand how ethics relates to product design because products are designed for people, and product design impacts the way we live.
 
# Data Representation 
# Numeric Conversions 
Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers. The difference is Decimal uses a base of ten, Binary uses a base of two, and hexidecimal uses a base of 16. 

# Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff represents a bright purple, In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 280.2 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%.
I would not consider this color to be problematic. What should be considered when choosing a color is people affected by a color vision deficiency.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the computer works like a team. Every piece of hardware has a unique job to do, when one piece is not doing its job properly the rest of the computer can not run properly. In order to keep your computer running properly you need to make sure you have all your hardware up to date.
