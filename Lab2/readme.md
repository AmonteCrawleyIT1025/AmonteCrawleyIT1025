# Executive Summary
 From this section I learned that the computer is not one part doing all the work. There are many parts of a computer that we fail to realize that makes the computer run properly. Many people tend to think it's time to buy a new computer, when really all the computer needs is an upgrade in hardware.
# Hard Drives
What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in a hard drive? The difference is that latency is the amount of time it takes for a desired sector to rotate under the read/write heads of the disk drive. While, transfer rate is the time it takes to transmit data from one spot to another.

What is the difference between a SSD hard drive and a traditional hard drive? The difference is that a SSD hard drive has no moving parts, while the traditional hard drive has moving parts. The traditional hard drive also takes very long to start up, because you have to wait for the disk to start spinning.  A SSD can be accessed immediately making it faster and more reliable.

Why does adding more RAM make a computer run faster? By increasing the amount of RAM on a computer more data can be loaded into the faster RAM without the need of constantly accessing the slower hard drive.

What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? The difference is 64 bit can transfer 64 bit of data at a time, making it faster than 32 bit. 32 bit can transfer 32 bit at a time.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the computer works like a team. Every piece of hardware has a unique job to do, when one piece is not doing its job properly the rest of the computer can not run properly. In order to keep your computer running properly you need to make sure you have all your hardware up to date.
