# Executive Summary
In Lab 4, I plan on learning more things on Python such as creating and executing a program. Using Python is extremely fun. I also plan on learning more about operating systems and programs. Also, I plan on learning the importance of the command prompt. My wholelife I always wondered what the command prompt was utilized for, I am excited to learn and understand it.
# Python IDLE
The Python shell is the interactive console. You can enter single commands and classes and functions into the shell. However, you canâ€™t save your code from the shell. IDLE is Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment. It allows programmers to easily write Python code. Just like Python Shell, IDLE can be used to execute a single statement and create, modify, and execute Python scripts.
## Code Examples
 A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. An example of a variable is spam = 42 which evaluates to 42.
 We use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. Example is Student = Geek print(student), The output would be geek.
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. An example of a function would be reverseing a sentence using recursion.
 There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.
 Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. There are three types Numeric, Sequence Type, and Boolean.

## Raster vs. Vector Graphics

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

#### File Formats

##### File Properties
I designed an imagine of a logo for Cyber security. My reaaoning for designing this logo was because I plan on opening my very own cyber security company in the future. The logo required three layers to create. 
The file size is  6,704 bytes. The file opens with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Notes, Safari, and TextEdit. Microsoft edge may be more appropriate becuase of the type of file it is.

# Conclusion
This Lab has been my favorite so far. Learning how to create and execute a code in Python really inspired me to learn more. After this Lab, I am going to practice everyday with this to become better and better. I also learned how to use the command tools on Mac and Microsft. Learning both will help me a lot in the future consdering everyone uses different operating systems.
