# Executive Summary
In Lab 4, I plan on learning more things on Python such as creating and executing a program. Using Python is extremely fun. I also plan on learning more about operating systems and programs. Also, I plan on learning the importance of the command prompt. My wholelife I always wondered what the command prompt was utilized for, I am excited to learn and understand it.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

#### File Formats

##### File Properties
I designed an imagine of a logo for Cyber security. My reaaoning for designing this logo was because I plan on opening my very own cyber security company in the future. The logo required three layers to create. 
The file size is  6,704 bytes. The file opens with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Notes, Safari, and TextEdit. Microsoft edge may be more appropriate becuase of the type of file it is.

# Conclusion
This Lab has been my favorite so far. Learning how to create and execute a code in Python really inspired me to learn more. After this Lab, I am going to practice everyday with this to become better and better. I also learned how to use the command tools on Mac and Microsft. Learning both will help me a lot in the future consdering everyone uses different operating systems.
