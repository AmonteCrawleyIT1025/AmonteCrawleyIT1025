# Executive Summary
In Lab 4, I plan on learning more things on Python such as creating and executing a program. Using Python is extremely fun. I also plan on learning more about operating systems and programs. Also, I plan on learning the importance of the command prompt. My wholelife I always wondered what the command prompt was utilized for, I am excited to learn and understand it.
# Python IDLE
The Python shell is the interactive console. You can enter single commands and classes and functions into the shell. However, you can’t save your code from the shell. IDLE is Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment. It allows programmers to easily write Python code. Just like Python Shell, IDLE can be used to execute a single statement and create, modify, and execute Python scripts.
## Code Examples
 A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. An example of a variable is spam = 42 which evaluates to 42.
 We use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. Example is Student = Geek print(student), The output would be geek.
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. An example of a function would be reverseing a sentence using recursion.
 There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.
 Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. There are three types Numeric, Sequence Type, and Boolean.

# Graphics

## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster graphics are made up of orderly arranged colored pixels to display any image. In simple terms its when a small image lose quality when you enlarge it. Vector graphics are quite different from raster. You can make them any size, big or small, without losing quality.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossy compression means that the image size is reduced while some data from the original image file is eliminated. The biggest benefit of lossy compression is that it significantly reduces the size of the image file. While, Lossless compression means that you reduce the size of an image without any quality loss. The big benefit and advantage of lossless compression are that it allows you to retain the quality of your images while reducing their file size.

#### File Formats
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a bitmap image format.It supports up to 8 bits per pixel, meaning that an image can have up to 256 distinct RGB colors. One of the biggest advantages to the GIF format is that it allows for animated images, something neither of the other formats allow. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is an image format that uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes. One of JPEG’s big advantages is that it allows the designer to fine-tune the amount of compression used. This results in better image quality when used correctly while also resulting in the smallest reasonable file size. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another bitmapped image format that uses lossless data compression and was created to replace the GIF image format. The PNG format was largely unsupported by Internet Explorer for a long time, making it less commonly used than GIF and JPEG formats, though it’s now supported properly by every major browser. PNG files support palette-based color (either 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA), greyscale, RGBA and RGB color spaces. One of PNG’s biggest advantages is that it supports a number of transparency options, including alpha channel transparency.


##### File Properties
I designed an imagine of a logo for Cyber security. My reaaoning for designing this logo was because I plan on opening my very own cyber security company in the future. The logo required three layers to create. 
The file size is  6,704 bytes. The file opens with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Notes, Safari, and TextEdit. Microsoft edge may be more appropriate becuase of the type of file it is.

# Conclusion
This Lab has been my favorite so far. Learning how to create and execute a code in Python really inspired me to learn more. After this Lab, I am going to practice everyday with this to become better and better. I also learned how to use the command tools on Mac and Microsft. Learning both will help me a lot in the future consdering everyone uses different operating systems.
